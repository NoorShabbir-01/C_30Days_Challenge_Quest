Sample Run:
Enter length of rectangle = 7
Enter width of rectangle = 9
Area of the rectangle = 63

Problem 2:
Write a program that takes five integers from the user in a single line and displays its sum and average (Up to two decimal places).

Sample Run:
First number: 7
Second number:7.0000
1

Problem 4:

and left shift of second number with 2.
Sample Run:
Enter two numbers: 3 5
3&5=1
3|5=7
3^5=6
3>>2=0
5<<2=20
